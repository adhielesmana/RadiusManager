7. Testing SSL...
curl: (60) SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target hostname 'isp.maxnetplus.id'
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the webpage mentioned above.

Done! Check if SSL error is gone above.
